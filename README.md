## Andr√©s Vargas.

## 1

The Collatz#sequence method solves this exercise.

## 2

With exercise_2.rb is found that n=327, and it's length is 144.

## 3

With exercise_3.rb is found that n=410011, and it's length is 449. The code took 4.84 seg to run.

## 4

I'm still trying to make the code from exercise_4.rb or exercise_4_alt.rb to work.
