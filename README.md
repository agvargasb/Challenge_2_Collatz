# Challenge #2: Collatz Conjecture.

## Andr√©s Vargas.

## 1

The Collatz#sequence method solves this exercise.

## 2

With exercise_2.rb is found that n=327, and its length is 144.

## 3

With exercise_3.rb is found that n=410011, and its length is 449. The code took 4.84 seg to run.

## 4

With exercise_4.rb is found that n=410011, and its length is 449, the same results from (3). The code took 0.26 seg to run.

## About parameters in Collatz#length:

Collatz#length has two parameters: The first one must be the number. The second parameter (keyword=optimal) is optional and its default value is false. When optimal: true, the method
implements the algorithms from exercise (4).
